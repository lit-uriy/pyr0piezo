## Documentation for Pyr0-Piezo Z-Probe Sensors

Pyr0-Piezo is a circuit design that incorporates the use of Piezoelectric Elements in order to reliably sense the real-world location of a 3D printer's bed. It incorporates a microcontroller (MCU) to sense the specific conditions of a printer that could effect the sensor's input, and make on-the-fly adjustments to ensure a consistent reading.

The latest firmware for this project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/pyr0ball/pyr0piezo/tree/master/firmware/Compiled-Firmware)

To request a mount for your printer, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pyr0ball/pyr0piezo/issues/new?assignees=pyr0ball&labels=add+support+request&template=printer-mount-request.md&title=%5BMOUNT%5D)

Here's a video I did back in the early days of beta explaining how the circuit works:
