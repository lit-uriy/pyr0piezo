# Pyr0-Piezo Installation Instructions

***Important***: Every printer is different, and this sensor can be adapted to any of them, however we may not currently have a mount designed for your needs. If that's the case, please [open an issue on the github](https://github.com/pyr0ball/pyr0piezo/issues/new?assignees=pyr0ball&labels=add+support+request&template=printer-mount-request.md&title=%5BMOUNT%5D) and/or send us a ping on the discord server.
